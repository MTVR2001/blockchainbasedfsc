Implementing blockchain based food supply chain system. This work develops and implements a distributed, secure and trustless architecture for FSC traceability

The concept of traceability is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to security sensitive areas like food and pharmacy. It is very important that traceability is maintained across the food supply 
systems. Food traceability Systems captures the information about a food, stores it and information is transferred. Also, the information about the feed, animals from which that food is produced or 
substances are captured, stored at every stage that is present in the Food Supply Chain (FSC). With the help of this process, the product can be verified for safety and quality is assured also, it can be 
tracked downward and upward at any time. The main characteristics that are essential for traceability systems are, identification all the units that consists of ingredients and also products, 
data regarding when those units are moved and also where they are moved and finally a system link the data that was acquired till now. With the advancement of technology and this traceability 
has now become the new quality index. As we have already mentioned, for tracing in FSC to be made possible, it is necessary to store and handle the sensitive information and this has become a 
mandatory case. Regulations are put in place to make it possible to trace and identify all of the ingredients used to make food items. All this effort we undergo is to ensure the safety of the food 
items and other items like medicines right from the manufacturer to consumer. Initially this was made possible with help of IoT technology. But this was difficult due to its complexity and its 
fragmentation. The food sector utilizes traceability technologies to enhance FSC and facilitate food safety and quality tracing. In this project, A dairy products related company's case study is 
considered for food traceability in order to help evaluate the viability of the suggested approach.

The approach used here is using blockchain to provide the required services. Blockchain has become one of the most booming technologies during recent years. The use of blockchain 
technology is a reality in many industries, and it is developing to be the most major technological revolution since the creation of the Internet. We are also using a concept related to blockchain that 
is smart contracts. The concept of smart contracts was first introduced to world by Szabo in the year 1997. It is a relatively new development in blockchain technology. Smart contracts give users 
the capacity to do computations on their own and these are done inside a blockchain, acting as a decentralized computer which is virtual. We can say that Smart Contracts are piece of codes that 
are executed automatically and self-controlled. A smart contract is generally understood to be a set of computer protocols that enable an agreement that is automatically performed while taking 
into consideration, a number of predetermined circumstances. The bulk of blockchain applications now in use incorporate smart contracts. We here create three smart contracts. Those are for 
Stakeholders, processes and products.
